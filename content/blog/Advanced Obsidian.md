My up-to-date [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) reference with solutions, opinions, preferences and conventions.

## Obsidian

- Keep up with the [official blog](https://obsidian.md/blog/) and [r/ObsidianMD](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/) (but not too much).

## Keybinds

- Use keybinds as much as possible.
- Document and maintain personal keybind conventions across different programs.

## Data structure

- Use templates as much as possible.
- Create and embed [Obsidian bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) in various places: Courses, Projects, Books, ...
## Tags

- Create most tags as notes instead of always using native tags: `~~#obsidian~~`.
- Use tags with atomic concepts: `#list`, `#comparison`.
- Use corresponding tags on templates to make them visible to dataview: `#book`.
- Mention tags on the top of the note: `Tags: Obsidian, #list`

## Vault and note management

- Stick to using one vault if you can.
- Keep track of all Obsidian-related questions and issues.
- Keep track of personal conventions to keep the notes consistent.
- Keep the collection synced with mobile. Easiest with the [official service](https://obsidian.md/sync).
- Use a single folder for notes. Do not organize main notes by folders.
- Link pages together and use the (local) graph view.
- Imitate hierarcy when needed.
	- A) Set up automatic [Maps of Content (MOC)](https://obsidian.rocks/maps-of-content-effortless-organization-for-notes/)
	- B) Maintain manual lists of notes under top-level categories
- Add aliases by typing `---` & `aliases`. Aliases work automatically.
- Merge accidentally created duplicate notes with the `Note composer` core plugin.
- Use alternative link text where necessary: `link text`.
- Split a note if it grows too large.

## Tasks

- Use the markdown syntax for tasks: `- [ ] do this thing`.
	- Dataview can pull these from any page.
- I haven't had a need for additional task plugins for now.

## Frontpage

- Create a frontpage (along with a keybind) with the `Homepage` plugin.
- Display the next incomplete tasks automatically from different domains of life:
	- https://gist.github.com/JesseK13241/d1e3c689fef5d338abc69c6935831e4e
## Linting

- Use `Linter` plugin for keeping notes clean and consistent.

## Daily notes

- Use `Daily notes` along with a personal template if you want to.

## Flashcards

- Generate and maintain flashcards with `Obsidian to Anki` plugin:
	- `word_in_finnish::word_in_english` (Basic and Reversed cards).
	- `This {cloze deletion syntax} is for generating cards with a part of the sentence hidden.`

## Location

- Track places with the `Map view` plugin.
- Generate the geolocation to the frontmatter along with a type field (library, restaurant, ...).

## Publishing

- [Blogi - Miksi](/blog/blogi-miksi) ðŸš§ 

## WIP

- [x] Dashboard (frontpage with metrics).
- [ ] Calendar that "works".
- [ ] RSS integration.
- [ ] Semantic links.
- ...
